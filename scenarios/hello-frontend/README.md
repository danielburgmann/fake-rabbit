# Hello frontend

This is a minimal web frontend to request `/hello.txt` endpoint of the fake-rabbit application.

`config.js` contains the backend base url. So one can deploy `hello-frontend.html` with another config.js for testing scenarios.

One can use this to **test distributed environments** where frontend and backend are served from different locations.
